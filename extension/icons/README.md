# Extension Icons

Please add the following icon files to this directory:
- `icon16.png` (16x16 pixels)
- `icon48.png` (48x48 pixels)
- `icon128.png` (128x128 pixels)

## Creating Icons

You can create icons using:
1. **Online Tools**: [icon.kitchen](https://icon.kitchen/), [Canva](https://www.canva.com/)
2. **Design Software**: Photoshop, GIMP, Figma
3. **Simple Approach**: Use a text editor to create a simple colored square with your initials

## Temporary Solution

Until you create proper icons, you can use placeholder images:
- Any PNG images of the correct dimensions will work
- The extension will load, but icons won't look professional

## Icon Guidelines

- Use simple, recognizable designs
- Ensure good contrast for visibility
- Keep it consistent with your brand
- Test on both light and dark backgrounds
